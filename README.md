# Fix Github

This chrome extension will remove the `.header-dark` class from Github pages so you can have your light-colored header back.

I have not published this in the Chrome Web Store yet, so if you want this, I suggest cloning the repo, enable developer mode for Chrome Extensions, and load this extension. Works like a charm.
